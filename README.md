# independent-project-website
The Independent Project is where you will show off what you have learned each week this semester. You will need to decide who the website will be designed for. Perhaps it is an imaginary client, or someone you know could benefit from a website redesign. Each week you will complete exercises in the textbook to learn how to add common features to your website. These exercises will be submitted early, to give you time to incorporate feedback. At the end of each week, you will add that week's feature or learning objective to your Independent Project. The Independent Project will be submitted in four phases, with the completed product submitted at the end of the semester. Once submitted, students will be required to evaluate the web sites of 3 other students.
